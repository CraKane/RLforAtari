# Description

- ## main.py is the all algorithm you can run with one seed. For all environment, you need use terminal parameter (--algorithm) to choose which one you run. The choices are [1, 2, 3]

  - 1: return R method
  - 2: value approximator method
  - 3: Policy Gradient with a baseline method

- ## test.py is the all algorithm you can run with different seeds. The implementing step is the same as 'main.py', the choice also are [1, 2, 3]

  - 1: return R method
  - 2: value approximator method
  - 3: Policy Gradient with a baseline method
