# RL for Atari
## Introduction
- It is an attempt for model-free algorithms, including DQN/DDPG/PPO/AC
## 3 envs
- Point-v0
- CartPole-v0
- Gravitar-ram-v0
## Methods
- As for Point & CartPole, we solved them by **Policy Gradient** algorithm to help us understand the basics of policy gradient algorithms.
- As for the most difficult env in Atari, Gravitar, we tried all kinds of tricks for model-free algorithms to see the performance.
## Code Folder
- "Point_CartPole" is the solution and environments for Point-v0 & CartPole-v0.
- "Gravitar" is the solution for Gravitar in Atari (Gym).
- "Ass4_report.pdf" is the report for Point-v0 & CartPole-v0.
- "Gravitar.pdf" is the report for Gravitar-ram-v0.
## NOTES
- other details are in "Ass4_report.pdf" and "Gravitar.pdf".
